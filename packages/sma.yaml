# This file includes all the entities for tracking sensor related to SMA Inverter and Home Manager.

# Sampling size is set to 720 since we want all samples for the last hour, where SMA updates every 5 second.

# Updates made for Core updates and breaking changes:
# --------------------------------------------------------
# 20221108 - Clear to upgrade to 2022.6.7 from 2022.5.3: https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2022/06/01/release-20226/#breaking-changes Template filter/function defaults
# 20221011 - Added hourly statistics for: grid_power and metering_power_supplied.
# 20241218 - Something happened at roughly 01:30, nearly all sensors for SMA failed to retrieve values. After removing and adding the SMA-integration again, sensors appeared.
#            However, they now had the sensor name altered 'sn_3006917520_daily_yield', i.e. added serial number to sensor.
#            No clue why, no reboot at the time, or intergration/HA upgraded.
#            I manually altered the following sensors to get back history data, and to not need to change yaml:
#            - sn_3006917520_metering_current_l1            to metering_current_l1

# ======================================================================================================================
#
# From end of March 2025, we started to measure the maximum power the house consumes (absorbs) each month.
# This to be able to measure the average of the maxium power over several high-load days for the month.
# All this related to Sweden starting to with 'effekttariff'.
#
# Effekttariff is a tariff based on high and low-load periods, instead of fixed cost related to the size of the main fuse, and a fixed cost per kWh for distributing electricity.
#
# We will measure the maximum power-load in W for high and low-loadperiods, and summarize at the end of the month.
# Note that the electricity provider for my region has not decided yet on how it will be measured, so we take into account several options.
#
# A typical High and low-load periods explained:
# ----------------------------------------------
# 1. High-load months (usually november through march):
#    - On weekdays (monday through friday), the day i split between high and low-load period.
#      - High-load is usually between 6 and 20 hours.
#      - Low-load are the remaining hours.
#      - On weekend the whole day is low-load period.
#      - Note that public holidays and bank holidays also count as weekend (i.e. low-load period).
#        - But we do not take this into account at the moment.
# 2. During low-load months (usually april through october):
#    - All days and hours are low-load periods.
#      - I.e. weekdays and hours are not utilized.
# 3. Some electricity providers reduces the highest load during low-load period by 50%. Thus, incentive to push load to low-load hours.
# 4. At the end of the month the highest load is taken by the average of 2 or multiple readings over the month.
#    - For instance the average of the three highest loads during high-load period during the month.
#
# As there are many options for what is measured and affects the cost for effekttariff, we take into consideration the following:
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - Monthly maximum hourly load.
# - Monthly maximum hourly load, during high-load hours.
# - Monthly maximum hourly load, during low-load hours.
# - Monthly maximum hourly load, during low-load hours, with factor parameter (see below).
# - Monthly maximum hourly-load for the month, for either high-load or low-load hours with reduction parameter.
# By doing this we support many options that can be used by Swedish electricity-providers.
#
# We will not take into account cost at the moment as this has not been set yet by the electricity provider in our region.
# The cost may be calculated towards any of the monthly sensors.
#
# In the logic above and below we have the following parameters:
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# - If enabled (input_boolean.setting_effekttariff_highload_month_enabled):
#   - High-load months, from and to.
#     - input_number.setting_effekttariff_highload_from_month (such as 10 for October)
#     - input_number.setting_effekttariff_highload_to_month (such as 3 for March)
# - If enabled (input_boolean.setting_effekttariff_highload_weekdays_enabled):
#   - High-load weekdays if enabled:
#     - input_boolean.setting_effekttariff_highload_weekday_monday
#     - input_boolean.setting_effekttariff_highload_weekday_tuesday
#     - input_boolean.setting_effekttariff_highload_weekday_wednesday
#     - input_boolean.setting_effekttariff_highload_weekday_thursday
#     - input_boolean.setting_effekttariff_highload_weekday_friday
#     - input_boolean.setting_effekttariff_highload_weekday_saturday
#     - input_boolean.setting_effekttariff_highload_weekday_sunday
# - If enabled (input_boolean.setting_effekttariff_highload_hours_enabled):
#   - High-load hours, from and to:
#     - input_number.setting_effekttariff_highload_from_hour (such as 6, from 6.00).
#     - input_number.setting_effekttariff_highload_to_hour (such as 20, to 20.59.59).
# - Highest load during low-load period is to be recalculated by factor (0 through 1, steps of 0.1).
#   - input_number.setting_effekttariff_lowload_factor
# - The number of highest day-loads (2 through 5) to average at the end of the month.
#   - input_number.setting_effekttariff_number_days_for_average
#
# The sensor that drives the machine is the statistics-sensor that measures the maximum power over one hour:
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max
#     - This sensor takes the statistics from sensor 'sensor.metering_power_absorbed' that is from the SMA-integration.
# Note that all values are in Watt not kiloWatt.
#
# We have created the following sensors:
# --------------------------------------
# 1. Each hour at 00.02  we set the input sensor (for persistence) 'sma_effekttariff_current_load_period' to high or low-load hour:
#    - Depending on the parameters above:
#      - 0 for no high/low hour, or error in parameters.
#      - 1 for low-load hour.
#      - 2 for high-load hour.
#    - Note: If parameters are changed between 00.02 and 59.56 it is not caught.
# 2. Each hour at 59.56 we take a snapshot of statistics sensor 'sma_metering_power_absorbed_max' into:
#    - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_hour
#       - This is the root of all measurements for load (W).
#       - We know that we will not get all/right statistics for the hour as we miss 4 seconds, but that should only have a minor effect.
# 3. Maximum hourly loads (input_numbers to be persistent to reboots and reload of yaml, reset each day at 00.00.02):
#    - input_number.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_hour_max: The maximum hourly-load.
#    - input_number.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_hour_max_high_load_period: The maximum hourly-load, during high-load hours.
#    - input_number.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_hour_max_low_load_period: The maximum hourly-load, during low-load hours.
# 4. Daily maximum loads are created each day at 23.59.57:
#    - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_day: The maximum hourly-load for the day.
#    - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_day_high_load_period: The maximum hourly-load for the day, during high-load hours.
#    - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_day_low_load_period: The maximum hourly-load for the day, during low-load hours.
#    - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_day_low_load_factor_period: The maximum hourly-load for the day, during low-load hours with factor parameter.
#    - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_day_high_and_low_load_factor_period: The maximum hourly-load for the day, for either high-load or low-load hours with factor parameter.
# 5. Array of 5 maximum days during the month are created after daily maximum are created through trigger (persistent, reset at 00.00.02 at start of each month):
#    - input_text.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_month_array: Array of 5 maximum load days for the month.
#    - input_text.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_month_high_load_period_array: Array of 5 maximum high-load days for the month.
#    - input_text.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_month_low_load_period_array: Array of 5 maximum low-load days for the month.
#    - input_text.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_month_low_load_factor_period_array: Array of 5 maximum low-load, with factor parameter, days for the month.
#    - input_text.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_month_high_and_low_load_factor_period_array: Array of 5 maximum for either high-load or low-load days with factor parameter, for the month.
# 6. Monthly maximum loads are created at end of month at 23.59.59 (taken from array):
#    - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_month: The maximum dayly-load for the month.
#    - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_month_high_load_period: The maximum high-load day for the month.
#    - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_month_low_load_period: The maximum low-load day for the month.
#    - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_month_low_load_factor_period: The maximum low-load day for the month with factor parameter.
#    - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_max_month_high_and_low_load_factor_period: The maximum hourly-load for the month, for either high-load or low-load hours with factor parameter.
# 7. Monthly average loads are created at end of month at 23.59.59 (taken from array, number of days is set by parameter):
#    - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_average_month: The average dayly-load for the month.
#    - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_average_month_high_load_period: The average high-load day for the month.
#    - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_average_month_low_load_period: The average low-load day for the month.
#    - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_average_month_low_load_factor_period: The average low-load day for the month with factor parameter.
#    - sensor.sma_metering_power_absorbed_average_month_high_and_low_load_factor_period: The maximum hourly-load for the month, for either high-load or low-load hours with factor parameter.
#
# Note the following:
# - The logic and sensors survives reboots.
#   - However, I have seen that reload of template-sensors causes duplicate values to be added to the array-sensors.
#     - So, if you need to reload temp+late-sensors, make sure you alter the array-sensors to original value after reload.

  # Automation setting the load-period based on inputs at 00.02 of the hour.
  # This means that if the inputs are changed after 00.02, it will not be changed until next hour.
  # The logic is:
  # - If months are enabled: Month must be valid.
  # - If weekdays are enabled: Weekday must be valid.
  # - If hours are enabled: Hour must be valid.
  # The following is returned:
  # 0 - No high/low-load period (defaults to this value if errors occur).
  # 1 - Low-load period.
  # 2 - High-load period.
